The focus of this research is to review the impact of the Coronavirus (“COVID-
19”) on the financial markets and produce an analysis of changes, trends, and
other meaningful conclusions from this preliminary investigation. We review how
asset correlations changed and review the behavior of markets both before and
after the Covid period. We analyze markets such as FX, Equities, Commodities,
and Fixed income securities to assess the statistical properties of financial markets
during the Covid period, examining key factors such as volatility, correlations
and market dynamics.
